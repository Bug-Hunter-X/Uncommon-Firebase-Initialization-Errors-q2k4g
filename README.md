# Uncommon Firebase Initialization Errors

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors that can occur during Firebase initialization and provides solutions for them.  The errors often stem from incorrect configuration or unexpected interactions with other parts of your application.

## Issues Addressed:

* **Incorrect Configuration:** Missing or incorrect values in `firebaseConfig` are common causes of failure. 
* **Multiple Initializations:** Attempting to initialize Firebase multiple times within an application can cause unexpected behavior. 
* **Version Conflicts:** Incompatibilities between the Firebase SDK version and other libraries. 

## Usage:

The repository contains two files:

* `firebaseBug.js`: Demonstrates code that contains common errors leading to Firebase initialization failure.
* `firebaseSolution.js`: Shows the corrected code with explanations of the fixes.

Ensure you replace placeholder values in firebaseConfig with your actual project details.
